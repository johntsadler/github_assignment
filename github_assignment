FOIA Lawya, a program from the New York Times, allows newsrooms and their associated lawyers to keep track of FOIA requests throughout the organizations. This is useful for a variety of reasons. Reporters who file numerous FOIA requests may lose track of the time since submissions and forget to reach back out to the organization for a follow-up. Other reporters, as stated in the description, can also check on their colleagues’ current projects in order to ensure that there is no repetition in requests. The program will also send out emails in order to ensure reporters do not forget about their requests: 10 business days after filing if request wasn’t acknowledged, 20 if the organization hasn’t handed over the docs, 90 days to remind to appeal, etc. Lawyers in the chain will receive the email after 90 days to prepare them for a possible appeal process. The program is also compatible with Slack. This program is highly useful and will save many FOIAs from going the route of their predecessors and gradually being forgotten or given up on.
